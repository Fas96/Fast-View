Methods vs Computed Properties vs Watchers

methods
--------------------------------------------
1. Use with event binding or data binding
2. Data binding: method is executed for every
"renderer" cycle of the component.
3. Use for events or data that really needs
to be reevaluated all the time.
--------------------------------------------

computed
--------------------------------------------
1. use with data binding
2. computed properties are only re-evaluated
if one of their 'used values' changed.
3. Use for data that depends on other data.
--------------------------------------------

watch
--------------------------------------------
1. not used directly in template
2. Allows you to run any code in reaction
to some changes data (e.g. send Http request etc.)
3. Use for any non-data update you want to make.
